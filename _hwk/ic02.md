Disregard the instruction above about "homework buddies" for this in-class assignment.  For this assignment:
* Collaborating with your neighbor is allowed and encouraged
* Asking for help from the professor is allowed and encouraged

Those conditions will NOT be true on the final exam.  This is just for practice.
