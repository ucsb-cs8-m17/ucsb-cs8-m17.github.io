# Abstractions and Algorithms


(a review of part of the syllabus)

Abstractions and notation: three, index.

An index takes in as input a topic, and gives us back a page number.

A Point-of-Sale bar code scanner at a store checkout maps a barcode, to info about the item (description and price).

A FUNCTION in general, takes in an input (or a set of inputs) and gives us back a value.

In math, for example, 

f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>
